# Pass an array as function argument

Bash has two array types: indexed and associative. An indexed array uses ordered numbers as item keys. Instead of that, an associative array uses arbitrary strings. Working with these arrays as function arguments may be confusing, so the examples below show how to work with them in a clear way.

Each script covers one use case and can be executed independently with bash.
